# Embracing Minimalism - Blog Card

This project is a minimalist blog card with a simple and elegant design. It uses HTML and CSS to create a card that presents an image and text in an attractive way.

## Description

The card contains the following elements:
- An image at the top, with a cropping style (`object-fit: cover`) to ensure it fits well within its container.
- A title (h1) introducing the blog content.
- A subtitle (h2) that describes the blog's topic.
- A paragraph describing the purpose of the blog, with a focus on minimalism.
- A footer with the author's name.

The design is fully responsive and utilizes a minimalist approach with a simple color palette.

## Features
